My computer science program is a program that helps find blue colours in images given by the user. This program can be very useful, especially in a ocean related setting as it can help spot corals. Corals are an important contributor to help provide oxygen to the Earth and support bio-diversity. Using 10 images I chose, with consideration to have barely or any fish, or blue corals to affect program, I will proves the usefulness of my program in a real-world case. Blue corals are one of the more rarer species of corals, so the fact I can not use this program with blue corals will not affect the usefulness of the program deeply (https://www.saltwateraquariumblog.com/coral-colors/). My program is programmed to recognize the ocean colour using a range of blue shades. As you know, corals are the colour of the ocean. If you subtract the ammount of pixels the entire image has with the ammount of blue pixels, you will get the remaining pixels that are not blue, which in my case are corals. This program also tells you the time it takes to analysis each photo to 3 decimal places. This makes it easy to tell how image size and the amount of pixels affect the performance of the program. Once all the images are processed, it gets stored into the master list which sorts the images from highest blue pixel percentage, to lowest blue pixel percentage. This program then shows you the top five images to have the most amount of blue pixels, which means the ones that have the least amount of corals. Binary search is implemented into the program to find an image closest to the minimum amount of blue pixels the user wants to find without going under that minimum. This helps you find oceans that meet this amount of corals. By seeing that one part of the ocean has 90% blue as a minimum, you can see it does not have as much corals. By analyzing large numbers of ocean images automatically, similar techniques could assist researchers in tracking reef coverage or changes over time.

TESTING AND DEBUGGING
This program was tested with 10 images in very different looking settings. Images that had more open water and more corals consistenly have more blue percentages than images that have more corals and less open water. I made sure the rbg scanner can correctly indentify ocean water without accidentally identifying other objects like fish or seaweed. I tested the program to see if the amount of blue pixels amounted to the amount of blue pixels I estimated across all the images. Edge cases, like darker images, or images with more shadow were tested to see if the program still worked the way it should work consistently.
