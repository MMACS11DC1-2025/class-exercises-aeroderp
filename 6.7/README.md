My computer science program is a program that helps find blue colours in images given by the user. This program can be very useful, especially in a ocean related setting as it can help spot corals. Corals are an important contributor to help provide oxygen to the Earth and support bio-diversity. Using 10 images I chose, with consideration to have barely or any fish, or blue corals to affect program, I will proves the usefulness of my program in a real-world case. Blue corals are one of the more rarer species of corals, so the fact I can not use this program with blue corals will not affect the usefulness of the program deeply (https://www.saltwateraquariumblog.com/coral-colors/). My program is programmed to recognize the ocean colour using a range of blue shades. As you know, corals are the colour of the ocean. If you subtract the ammount of pixels the entire image has with the ammount of blue pixels, you will get the remaining pixels that arent blue, which in my case are corals. EDGE CASES AND STUFF CONT
